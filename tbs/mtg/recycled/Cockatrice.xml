		<!-- Text(5th+errata): 2/4, Flying. ; Whenever ~this~ blocks or becomes 
		     blocked by a non-Wall creature, destroy that creature at end of 
		     combat. [Oracle 00/02/01] -->

		<!-- A non-wall creature blocking or blocked by this card gets a "destroy 
		     at end of combat" effect placed on it when it is assigned as a blocker 
		     or this card is assigned to block it.  The effect is added to a 
		     creature which becomes a blocker by any means, including being part of 
		     a band which is blocked or by being moved into blocking or being 
		     blocked by an effect such as General Jarkeld.  This effect stays even 
		     if the creature is removed from the blocking situation by an ability 
		     like General Jarkeld. [WotC Rules Team 95/09/22] -->
