	<!-- 
		Card Type:  	 Instant
		P/T: 	
		Rules Text (Oracle): 	Counter target spell. 
		If an artifact or creature spell is countered this way, put that card 
		into play under your control instead of into its owner's graveyard.
		
		* 04/10/2004 The card is put into play, but any effects that check if 
		the original card was "played from your hand" will not trigger or 
		otherwise consider the card to have been played from your hand. 
		The card was put into play by the effect of Desertion instead.
		* 04/10/2004 This spell includes a replacement effect. If the target 
		is an artifact or creature, it never goes to the graveyard.
		* 04/10/2004 If the spell is not countered (because the spell it 
		targets can't be countered), then this card's ability does not put 
		the card into play. The card continues to resolve as normal.
