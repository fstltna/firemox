<b>Welcome to Firemox</b>

Firemox 0.95


				Firemox (FM) is a full Java program which allows players to play various card games
				against an opponent over a network, such as a LAN and the Internet, or alone. The
				program is the judge: it implements and enforces the rules, so that the players do
				not need to resolve them themselves.

				At the moment, network play requires the IP address of your opponent, but we are
				working on a client/server option which will allow players to host and connect to
				game servers. The game currently runs Magic: The Gathering
				but rules can be written for any classic card game (eg. Poker) or collectible card
				game (CCG).

				The main feature of this program is that it can parse the rules of a game which are
				defined in an (human readable) XML file. MP parses these rules files to determine
				turn structure, card types, colors, etc.. making it impossible for players to cheat.
				Also, if a player forgets to do something during the game, he/she will be reminded
				since all rules are managed by MP.

				Highlights:
					* Written in Java: works on Mac, Windows and Linux
					* Highly customizable and extensible rules
					* Is fully skinnable using Look &amp; Feel control settings
					* Free and open-source
					* Customizable language settings

				You need Java 5.0 or Java 6.0u3 (recommended) -> http://java.com/download/index.jsp
				to run Firemox !
